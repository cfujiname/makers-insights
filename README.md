## _After Week 1_

## What do I need to improve and how to get there

* Anxiety and blanking when other people are watching me code

-_take my time to take notes, if needed, use pen and paper to structure the thought processes instead of rushing into the terminal and text editor_

* Practice more exercises

-_after securing my hot desking space, focus on self-led-learning, making use of the practicals provided by the course_

* Revise concepts such as instance variables, local variables, OOP.

-_seek for help in different media, such as youtube videos and coding for dummies. Sometimes the sources provided are very difficult to 
read, so try to find something that I can uderstand better_

* Create a Weekly Calendar for a structured learning process

-_set smaller goals for each day, so it is easier to track progress_
